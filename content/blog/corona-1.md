Dear friends and supporters of DevFest Toulouse,

The current events of the coronavirus epidemy are in all our hearts and minds.

This year's DevFest Toulouse is scheduled for November 5th and 6th, which is in **more than 6 months**. As organizers, we hope that by then the situation will have settled enough for the event to happen **without postponement** or cancellation. 

However, at the present time, we believe that the social distanciation rules bring significant disruption to all of us. They're also important. It is these rules that must hold our full attention for the following weeks.

This is why, even if proceeding safely would be possible, **we have decided to postpone the opening of the sponsoring offers, the CFP, and the ticketing for our 2020 edition**. Let's all focus on our families, and concentrate on following all guidelines to preserve our health and lighten the burden on our health care system as much as possible. The DevFest Toulouse 2020 can wait for a bit. We'll all be ready to work harder when things settle down. **The opening of the sponsorship offers, the opening of the CFP and the opening of ticket sales are therefore postponed until further notice**.

We will get back to you as soon as possible.

As always, stay tuned by following:

See you soon,

The DevFest Toulouse team
